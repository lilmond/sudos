# Introducing sudos 2.7.0
Too long have passed since the last update, so I decided to upgrade this tool to a new level. New attack methods and features have been added, even more will be added later. I will be documenting about it all later. Thank you for your support!

Little fun fact: The example shown below uses `http-get-rapid` attack method. This method can hit up to 1K HR/s with only 20 socket connections when used correctly.

Supports attacks via Tor. This is just an example and not actually "real". Do not take this seriously. This tool isn't powerful enough to get you behind bars, still don't use it for malicious purposes as I will not take accountability for your actions.

                               Try out the other attack methods, list:
                             ["http-get", "http-get-rapid", "http-post",
                                "http-post-slow", "http-post-custom",
                                   "ssl-flood", "websocket-flood"]
                         
                         
usage: sudos.py [-h] [-t THREADS] [-m ATTACK METHOD] [-d DELAY] [-c TIMEOUT] [-l FILE]

                URL

Layer-7 Python DDoS Tool.

positional arguments:
  URL                   Target's full URL.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t THREADS, --threads THREADS
                        Attack threads. The more, the stronger. Default: 20
  -m ATTACK METHOD, --method ATTACK METHOD
  -d DELAY, --delay DELAY
                        Sleep time between HTTP requests. Tip: setting this to 0 with http-get-
                        rapid method may cause critical damage to the target, even with only 20
                        threads. Though may cause the statistics to be innacurate, so set only to
                        at least 0.1.
  -c TIMEOUT, --timeout TIMEOUT
                        Socket connection timeout. Default: 10
  -l FILE, --proxy-list FILE
                        Use a custom proxy list. You can use Proxal to get a good proxy list.
  -H HEADERS, --headers HEADERS
                        Add an HTTP header. Example: -H/--header "Authorization:
                        someauthorizationheadervalue"
  -q, --quiet           Supress error messages.
  --duration DURATION   Set how long the attack will be running for. This is by default is set to
                        None and will keep running forever until stopped manually.
  --payload PAYLOAD     This is required to define HTTP-POST-CUSTOM payload.
  --test                Use this for testing and viewing the web server's response to the attack's
                        request.
  --tor                 Use Tor proxies for the attack.
