# SuDOS

SuDOS is a proxy-based DDOS tool (pseudo-botnet) written in Python with live statistics display program.

Read the official documentation here: https://github.com/lilmond/sudos/blob/main/docs/manual.md

## What's new?
- You don't need to worry about getting a proxy list anymore as we already implemented a proxy list scraper in the tool.
- We completely removed the HTTP statistics as we cannot accurately collect data from it.
- Added custom header parameters.
- Live display with curses.
